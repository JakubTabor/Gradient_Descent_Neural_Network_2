# Gradient_Descent_Neural_Network_2
I gonna build neural network from scratch also with gradient descent inside 
# First I need activation function for my model so I define sigmoid function, It will eturn value in  range 0 to 1
# Now my "prediction_function", so i fill paterrn which is (w1 * x1 + w2 * x2 + bias) I save it as "weighted_sum" and return activation of my "weighted_sum"
# Then I check if my function works good and it seems that everything is alright
