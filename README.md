# Gradient_Descent_Neural_Network_2
I gonna build neural network from scratch also with gradient descent inside 
# I gonna use simple dataset with only three columns to make things simple
# I have my data ready, so I import "train_test_split" and put age and affordibility as X variable and bought_insurance as y variable
