# First I load my simple dataset which include three columns : area, bedrooms and	price
# Now I need to scale my data, so I import "MinMaxScaler" from "preprocessing", and put inside area and bedroom columns I save it as X_scaled 
# Then I scale price column and I also reshape it into 2D array, I save it as y_scaled 
# Now I gonna build from scratch batch gradient descent, I gonna need here X, y_true, epochs and lerning_rate which I set to (0.01)
