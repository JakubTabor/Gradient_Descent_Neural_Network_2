# First I load my simple dataset which include three columns : area, bedrooms and	price
# Now I need to scale my data, so I import "MinMaxScaler" from "preprocessing", and put inside area and bedroom columns I save it as X_scaled 
# Then I scale price column and I also reshape it into 2D array, I save it as x_scaled
# Now I gonna build from scratch batch gradient descent, I gonna need here X, y_true, epochs and learning_rate which I set to (0.01)
# First I pass "number_of_features", so "area and bedroom", shape of it will be in rows and columns
# Then I initialize my weights with ones and set shape as previous saved "number_of_features", also initialize bias with zero
# And I pass shape of "total_samples" for later which is " X.shape[0]"
# I create two empty list to record cost and epochs and later plot them 
# Then I make for loop in length of my epochs, inside I define "y_predicted", which is dot product of w1, w2 and X transpose, plus bias
