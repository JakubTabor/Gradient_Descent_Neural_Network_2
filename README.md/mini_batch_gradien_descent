# Mini Batch Gradient Descent use batch of randomly picked samples for a forward pass and then adjust weights
# In comparison to (Batch Gradient Descent) which use "all" training samples and (Stochastic Gradient Descent) which use "one" random sample for forward pass
# Its also good for big datasets, as well as "SGD", because it use batch of samples to train the model
