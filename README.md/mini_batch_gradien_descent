# Mini Batch Gradient Descent use batch of randomly picked samples for a forward pass and then adjust weights
# In comparison to (Batch Gradient Descent) which use "all" training samples and (Stochastic Gradient Descent) which use "one" random sample for forward pass
# Its also good for big datasets, as well as "SGD", because it use batch of samples to train the model
# I import and prepare my dataset as previous and scale all columns
# Now I can build "Mini Batch Gradient Descent", first i put some features, (X and y_true, number of epochs, batch size and learning rate)
# Then I define "number_of_features", which are (area and bedroom), it will be "X.shape[1]"
# Then I initialize weights with "ones" and pass shape which are my previous defined features
