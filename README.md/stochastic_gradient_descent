# Now Its time to build stochastic gradien descent, I gonna need to import random 
# I gonna need to build my function this same things as previous, so X, y_true, epochs and learning rate, which I set to (0.01)
# Now I gonna pass this same variables as previous, so I define "number_of_features", weights, bias and "total_samples"
